# Security Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security improvements made to remove external telemetry and data collection from the Vibe Kanban application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Sentry DSN
- **File**: `frontend/src/main.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed hardcoded Sentry DSN that pointed to bloop-ai organization
- **Result**: Sentry will only initialize if both `VITE_ENABLE_SENTRY=true` AND `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` are provided

### 2. Removed PostHog Analytics
- **File**: `backend/build.rs`
- **Change**: Removed PostHog API key and endpoint environment variable processing
- **Result**: No PostHog analytics infrastructure remains in the build process

### 3. Removed Privacy Opt-In Dialog
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/PrivacyOptInDialog.tsx` (deleted)
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed the privacy dialog component and telemetry acknowledgment UI
- **Result**: No user data collection consent flows exist

### 4. Removed Analytics Tracking
- **Files**: Multiple backend files
- **Change**: Removed all `track_analytics_event` calls throughout the codebase
- **Result**: No analytics events are tracked anywhere in the application

### 5. Removed Telemetry Configuration
- **File**: `backend/src/models/config.rs`
- **Change**: Removed `telemetry_acknowledged` and `analytics_enabled` fields from Config
- **Result**: No telemetry configuration options exist

### 6. Removed Analytics Service
- **File**: `backend/src/services/analytics.rs` (deleted)
- **File**: `backend/src/app_state.rs`
- **Change**: Removed entire analytics service and all related infrastructure
- **Result**: No analytics code exists in the application

## Sentry Configuration

### Frontend
Sentry is **disabled by default** in the frontend. It will only activate if:
1. Environment variable `VITE_ENABLE_SENTRY` is explicitly set to `'true'`
2. Environment variable `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` is provided with a valid DSN

### Backend
Sentry is **disabled by default** in the backend. It will only activate if:
1. Environment variable `ENABLE_SENTRY` is explicitly set to `'true'`
2. Environment variable `SENTRY_DSN` is provided with a valid DSN

### Verification
To verify Sentry is disabled in your deployment:
```bash
# Check frontend environment
echo $VITE_ENABLE_SENTRY  # Should be empty or not 'true'
echo $VITE_SENTRY_DSN      # Should be empty

# Check backend environment
echo $ENABLE_SENTRY        # Should be empty or not 'true'
echo $SENTRY_DSN           # Should be empty
```

## Remaining External Connections

The only external connections remaining are:
1. **GitHub API** - Required for pull request creation and monitoring (core functionality)
2. **Sentry** - Only if explicitly enabled with proper configuration

## Summary

All telemetry, analytics, and data collection infrastructure has been removed from the application. The only remaining external service integration is GitHub API for core functionality, and Sentry for error tracking which is disabled by default and requires explicit opt-in configuration.
